- Accuracy: OCR is not 100% accurate, and the accuracy of OCR output can vary depending on a number of factors, such as the quality of the scanned image, the type of font used, and the complexity of the text. OCR is generally more accurate with printed text than with handwritten text.

- Language and font support: Not all OCR software supports all languages and fonts. It is important to make sure that the OCR software you use supports the languages and fonts that you need to work with.

- Formatting errors: OCR software may not be able to accurately preserve the formatting of a scanned document, such as bold, italics, and underlining. This can be a problem for documents such as forms and spreadsheets.

- Dependency on image quality: The quality of the scanned image has a significant impact on the accuracy of OCR output. Scanned images should be clear and well-focused, with a high resolution.

- Handwritten text: Handwritten text can be difficult for OCR software to interpret, especially if the handwriting is sloppy or uneven.

- Mathematical formulas: Mathematical formulas can also be difficult for OCR software to interpret, especially if the formulas contain complex symbols or equations.

- Colored paper: OCR software may have difficulty with scanned images of documents that are printed on colored paper. 

- Blurry or skewed images: OCR software may have difficulty with scanned images that are blurry or skewed.
